# manageServices
 
 ## Purpose
 This script is for systems that might have a bit more security.  You can automate turning services on and off.

 ### Switches
 I only use one switch for this.  This switch is the "State" switch.  You can modify the sript to add or change the servers you care about.  use the switch to turn them on or off.  Really handy if you need to fix a bunch of machines where the firewall was turned off and SCCM agent is struggling.
